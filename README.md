## [Latest version: v1.1 - Made for Minecraft 1.21.5]
Introducing Desolate Pale Garden, a small datapack which removes all hostile mob spawns from the Pale Garden while still allowing the Creaking to spawn. This datapack was created out of request because of the regular hostile mobs' spawning taking away from the quiet, lonely, creepy nature of the Pale Garden biome.
